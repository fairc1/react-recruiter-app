The goal of the ‘Recruiter Dashboard’ App is to have a place where recruiters can store, update, and organize every potential new candidate wanting to join their company. The App is constructed to easily allow users to add information about candidates to the database and updated throughout the hiring process. Moreover, a candidate’s profile can be delated and any time to keep a clean and streamlined view for users. Security was a high priority in the creation of this app, which is why individuals can only access their own data by means of a registration and authorization process.
